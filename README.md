Thx for Bad#3911 for making the head of the bird.

This code is a self learning code, the way it learn is by simulation the naturral selection rool of nature of basically "the strong survive".
basically we generate at the start 100 different birds, the we run the script, the top 5 birds are  gonna be copied and have mutations done to them
so they can evolve, after 50-100 generations you will get beast hapes that can play the game perfectly.
